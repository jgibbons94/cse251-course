# 11 Prove: Cruise Ship

## Overview

You will be implementing passengers boarding a cruise ship

## Assignment

The project file is `assignment.py` in the `week11/assignment` folder in GitHub.  Refer to this file for instructions.

### Sample output of the assignment

From the sample output below, you can see that when security officers are adding a passenger to the passenger list, no other officer or director is accessing the list.  When a director gains access to the passenger list, you can see other directors also accessing it.  The first directory to start reading displays a message "start reading..." and the last directory to finish reading will display "Stop reading..."

```
