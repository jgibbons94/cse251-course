Passengers (TOTAL_PASSENGERS) will be boarding a cruise ship.  Security
officers will add arriving passengers to a pasenger list.  There will be
mulitple entry points to get on the ship.  While the boarding process is going
on, ship directors will check the passenger list now and then so they can do
any planning they need to do.

While security offices are updating the pasenger list, no other security
officer or director can be using the list.

Directors can not read the passenger list if any security officer is updating
the list.  However, mulitple directors can read the list at the same time.

When Security and directors get access to the passenger list, they will take
security_processing(), director_processing() amount of time with
the list.  When they are not using the list, they will wait using these
functions security_waiting() and director_waiting() before trying
to access the passenger list again.

Passneger list: Each passenger has an ID.  There IDs will be integers starting at 1.  
The first will use ID = 1, the second passenger to arrive will use 2, etc.

Instructions:

- Use processes for the security (SECURITY_PERSONAL) and directors (DIRECTOR_PERSONAL)
- Make sure the directors print the messages STARTING_READING_MESSAGE and STOPING_READING_MESSAGE
- When using locks, the acquire() method must not use the timeout or block options. (ie., just lock.acquire())
- This problem is harder if you use the Python 'with lock:' statement.
- Add lots of print statements while debugging your program.  Remove them before 
  you submit your assignment.
- Use only the imported packages below.
